## Notes

* Add feature files
* Add [Cucumber JUnit Runner](https://cucumber.io/docs/cucumber/api/?lang=java#junit)
* Run the Runner class in IntelliJ which will generate the code snippets for missing step definitions.
* Rename the step defs method arguments to reflect the parameters.
* Change the `dryrun` to false, and remove the `throw new io.cucumber.java.PendingException();` from stepdefs.
* Rerun the test to make sure that all the steps pass.
